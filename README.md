### Interview Task: Dasboard for (doctors, patients) with CRUD operations

- faked api with hardcoded "fakeApi" in pinia stores.
- used _pinia-plugin-persistedstate_ to persist data in session, as long the app
  didn't reload.
- added basic login and guards with vue-router.
- used SCSS.
- added form for Crud Operation in the end of Doctors/Patients pages so that you
  can see the update instantly (it's just a demo).
- Deployed with github actions
  [here](https://m-shrief.github.io/basic_dashboard/).
